## Molecular Data Generation in Faraday

Faraday provides powerful controlled data generation capabilities to help you expand your chemical libraries and explore new molecular space systematically. Generate a user-defined number of novel molecules starting from any valid, drug-like structure(s), enabling comprehensive SAR exploration, analog generation, library expansion, and scaffold hopping.

## Controlled Data Generation

Generate a user-defined number of novel molecules starting from any valid, drug-like structure(s). Faraday supports multiple approaches to molecular generation, allowing you to explore chemical space in a controlled and systematic manner.

Key capabilities include:
- **SAR exploration** – Generate analogs to understand structure-activity relationships
- **Analog generation** – Create similar molecules with desired modifications
- **Library expansion** – Scale up your compound collections efficiently
- **Scaffold hopping** – Explore alternative core structures with similar properties
- **User-defined quantities** – Generate exactly the number of molecules you need
- **Drug-like filtering** – Ensure generated molecules meet pharmaceutical standards

**Sample prompts:**
- Generate 50 analogs of [SMILES string]
- Create a library of 100 molecules similar to aspirin
- Generate scaffold hops for this compound: [SMILES]
- Expand my dataset with 200 drug-like molecules based on these structures
- Create analogs with improved solubility for [compound name]
- Generate diverse molecules for SAR exploration around this hit: [SMILES]
