## ADMET Analysis in Faraday

Faraday provides comprehensive ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) analysis capabilities to help you identify potential safety issues and optimize drug candidates early in the discovery process. From structural alerts to predictive modeling, Faraday can analyze your compounds and flag potential liabilities before they become costly late-stage failures.

## ADMET Structural Alerts

Faraday includes a built-in ADMET structural alert filter that flags undesirable substructures associated with toxicity, poor metabolism, or assay interference. This helps you focus on high-quality candidates early in the drug discovery process by identifying:

- Toxicity-associated substructures
- Metabolic liability patterns
- Assay interference motifs
- Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS)
- Reactive functional groups

**Sample prompts:**
- Check for ADMET alerts in [SMILES string]
- Screen this compound for toxicity flags: [SMILES]
- What safety concerns does this molecule have?
- Identify potential PAINS in my compound library
