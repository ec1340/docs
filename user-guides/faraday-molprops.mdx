# Molecular Property Calculations in Faraday

Faraday provides comprehensive molecular property calculation capabilities to support your drug discovery workflows. From basic physicochemical properties to advanced ADMET predictions, Faraday can analyze your compounds and provide actionable insights.

## Basic Molecular Properties

Calculate foundational properties like molecular weight (MW), logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, TPSA, Lipinski rule violations, overall Lipinski compliance, etc.

**Sample prompts:**
- Calculate molecular properties for [SMILES string]
- Check Lipinski compliance for this compound: [SMILES]
- What are the basic properties of aspirin?

## Example:

> calculate the properties of imatibin and nilotinib
