# Molecule Optimization in Faraday

Faraday provides powerful molecule optimization capabilities to help you generate novel molecules with improved drug-like properties using multi-objective optimization. Whether you're looking to enhance existing compounds or explore new chemical space, Faraday can systematically optimize your molecules across multiple parameters simultaneously.

## Multi-Objective Optimization

Faraday helps you generate novel molecules with improved drug-like properties using advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms. The platform can simultaneously optimize across multiple molecular properties to find the best balance for your specific requirements.

Currently supported optimization properties include:

- **QED** – Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness
- **TPSA** – Topological Polar Surface Area
- **MolLogP** – Lipophilicity
- **ExactMolWt** – Molecular weight

**Sample prompts:**
- Optimize [SMILES string] for better drug-likeness
- Improve the QED and reduce molecular weight of this compound: [SMILES]
- Generate analogs with better ADMET properties
- Optimize this molecule for oral bioavailability
- Balance lipophilicity and solubility for [compound name]
