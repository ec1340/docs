## What is Faraday

Faraday is aiming to be your most capable co-worker to accelerate your Target-to-Candidate Workflows.

Our AI-powered drug discovery platform streamlines tasks ranging from literature mining to molecular optimization. With a natural-language interface, you can interact directly with Faraday through our web-based chat interface. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, Faraday goes beyond simple search and information retrieval: it has a deeper understanding of biomolecules and chemical data, and it can leverage specialized computational tools to actively solve problems and accelerate your workflows.

Simply type your request—such as identifying drug targets, analyzing molecules, or generating new candidates—and Faraday’s proprietary model will:

- Interpret your prompt
- Break it into logical steps
- Select the appropriate tools
- Execute the necessary code
- Deliver the results

In addition to receiving answers and next-step suggestions, you can also view the reasoning process by clicking ‘Thought’, and access the code executed by clicking ‘Code’, and see the tool being used by clicking ‘Tool’.
