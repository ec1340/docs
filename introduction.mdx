## Welcome
In this documentation we will help you get started with Ascent Bio.
Ascent Bio is a platform for designing molecules and serves as a reasoning engine for molecular data.


## Setting up
First step to using the molecule design platform is to sign up for an account. If you've been invited, following the instructions on the email. 
While the platform is currently in closed alpha, please join our waiting list using our [homepage](https://www.ascentbio.xyz/alpha)


## Using the API
We'll cover the the endpoints available in our platform, which allows you to perform different tasks vital to small molecule hit-to-lead workflow.

The endpoints are organized into the following categories:
- Design (Property Optimization)
- Generate (Molecule Generation) (coming soon)

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Design (Property Optimization)">

        The Design endpoint enables optimization of chemical properties using our foundation model for small molecules. The model leverages latent space optimization, 
        combined with extensive reference databases, to ensure high-quality outputs. 
        
        
        The process is straightforward - simply provide a starting molecule and specify which property to optimize. 
        Send this request to the **design** endpoint and receive candidate molecules within seconds.

        We currently support optimization of any one or more of the following properties: `['qed', 'TPSA', 'MolLogP', 'ExactMolWt']`
