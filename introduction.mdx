## Welcome
In this documentation we will help you get started with the Ascent Bio platform.

## Setting up
First step to using the AI Scientist platform is to sign up for an account. If you've been invited, following the instructions on the email. 
While the platform is currently in closed alpha, please join our waiting list using our [waiting list](https://www.ascentbio.xyz/join)


## Faraday
Faraday is aiming to be your most capable co-worker to accelerate your Target-to-Candidate Workflows.

Our AI-powered drug discovery platform streamlines tasks ranging from literature mining to molecular optimization. With a natural-language interface, you can interact directly with Faraday through our web-based chat interface. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, Faraday goes beyond simple search and information retrieval: it has a deeper understanding of biomolecules and chemical data, and it can leverage specialized computational tools to actively solve problems and accelerate your workflows.






## Using the API 
We'll cover the the endpoints available in our platform, which allows you to perform different tasks vital to small molecule hit-to-lead workflow.

The endpoints are organized into the following categories:
- Design (Property Optimization)
- Generate (Molecule Generation) (coming soon)

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Design (Property Optimization)">

        The Design endpoint enables optimization of chemical properties using our foundation model for small molecules. The model leverages latent space optimization, 
        combined with extensive reference databases, to ensure high-quality outputs. 
        
        
        The process is straightforward - simply provide a starting molecule and specify which property to optimize. 
        Send this request to the **design** endpoint and receive candidate molecules within seconds.

        We currently support optimization of any one or more of the following properties: `['qed', 'TPSA', 'MolLogP', 'ExactMolWt']`
