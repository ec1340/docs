# Introduction
Our model enables fast, multi-property optimization compared to many off-the-shelf options.

### API Features

## Molecule Design
Generate molecule designs with a simple request.

### Authentication
In order to use our API you need to get your `ascent-api-key` first. This will be available in your profile settings. 

### Endpoint
`https://ascentbio--ab-design-apiv4-01-inference-dev.modal.run/design`

### Request Body

#### smiles

The SMILES representation of the molecule to be designed.

#### changes 

The properties to optimize for (one or more of `['qed', 'TPSA', 'MolLogP', 'ExactMolWt']`).

**note:** `changes` is a dictionary with the keys being the properties to optimize for and the values being `['increase', 'decrease']`.

#### model

The specific model to use for molecule design. This allows you to select different models based on your requirements.
We currently support `ascentbio-v1-base-large`

### Example Request

```python
import requests

url = "https://ascentbio--ab-design-apiv4-01-inference.modal.run/design"

headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "ascent-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

data = {
    "smiles": "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O",
    "changes": {"qed": "increase"},
    "model": "ascentbio-v1-base-large"  # Specify the model to use
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```
