# Quick Start

### Authentication
In order to use our API you need to get your `ascent-api-key` first. This will be available in your profile settings. 

## Molecule Design
Generate molecule designs with a simple request like the following Python example:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.ascentbio.xyz/v1/design"

headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "ascent-api-key": "<ascent-api-key>"
}

data = {
    "smiles": "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O",
    "target_props": ["TPSA"],
    "target_changes": [1]
    "model_id": "ascentbio-v1-base-large",
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
```
